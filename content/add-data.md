## Find Data to add to your map on Vnacouver Open Data Portal

[The Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/) is an excellent source for a variety of municipal data, including geographic data layers such as point, lines, polygons, and raster images. 

As long as the data you are looking at has a geographic element, you can download it as a GeoJSON to add as a layer to your ArcGIS Online webmap. Use the export tab to download.

## Add Data from File

On the sidebar on the left, click on **Layers**, then on **Add layer** in the **Layers** pane that opens.

You can add a layer from a URL or from file. If you are adding from file, a GeoJSON file is the easiest to use. Ensure you export any files from your GIS or download any files you find as GeoJSON.

## Add Data from the Living Atlas

You can also add data from the [Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/), a large collection of geographic information compiled and created by [Esri.](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)

From the dropdown arrow next to My Content, select Living Atlas and you can search for layers to add.

*Note: If you only have a public ArcGIS account, you will have access to fewer layers in the Living Atlas.*
