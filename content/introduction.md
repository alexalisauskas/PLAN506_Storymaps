### **Overview of ArcGIS Online**
## [Web Map](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-web-map.htm)
According to ESRI: "An ArcGIS web map is an interactive display of geographic information that you can use to tell stories and answer questions...Maps contain a basemap, a set of data layers (many of which include interactive pop-up windows with information about the data), an extent, and navigation tools to pan and zoom. In general, the basemap and layers are hosted and shared through ArcGIS Online. However, maps can also contain layers added directly to the map and layers and basemaps referenced externally. Many maps also contain scaled symbols and other smart styling that reveal data and patterns as you interact with it."

### **Why Choose ArcGIS Online?**
- No install necessary
- Don't have to know any programming languages or how to code
- No server needed to host your published maps and data
- Can collaborate on and share maps
- Can easily embed web maps, apps, and story maps in websites

### **ArcGIS Free vs. Enterprise Account**

An ArcGIS free account can be created by anyone and is intended for noncommercial, nongovernmental use. When using ArcGIS StoryMaps with a public account, some advanced storytelling and customization features are **not available**, including:

- embedding web pages
- customizing story theme and logo
- Google analytics tracking ID
- including Audio
- image galleries
- timelines

You can still include images and video, embed map tours, and use the swipe tool.

A free account on ArcGIS online does not allow you to do any spatial analysis on your webmap like you could on a desktop GIS.

### **Supported Data Type of ArcGIS Online**

If you have privileges to create content, you can add many types of content as item to ArcGIS online. Please check the [ArcGIS online supported data](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/supported-items.htm) file here.

- The most common data type that we use is Shapefile. If you have ArcGIS online organization account you can zip the shapefiles in a folder can upload the zip file to ArcGIS online account. If you have access to **free public account**, please convert your shapefile to other format such as **KML** or **geoJSON** before you upload them to ArcGIS online account.
