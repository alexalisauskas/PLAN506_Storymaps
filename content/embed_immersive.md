## Embed immersive content and media to the Story Map

### Sidecar
You can combine text and image through immersive scrolling with **sidecar**. There are three layouts of sidecar, **Docked**, **Floating** and **Slideshow**.

Add your text, and select a visual to add - this could be a colour, image, map, or slide.

### Embed a map
You can embed a **webnamap** that you've created on ArcGIS Online in your StoryMap. You can also create an **express map** using drawn features to include.

### Swipe
You can use the Swipe to let readers easily compare two maps (webmap or express) or images with an interactive slider. This is great to show changes over time. 

{: .note}
There is a limit on the size of image you can upload, so if you are planning on using raster images, they may need to be resized.

### Map tour
You can create a **map tour** to showcase a set of places your readers can explore in any order, or be led through one at a time. C

There are two options of zoom level. **Use map tour setting** will automatically adjust the zoom level so all points are visible simultaneously. **Use current zoom level** will keep the zoom level always be street or city. The zoom level can be changed in map option.

{: .note}
The **Map Options** on the top right corner of Map Tour can adjust the map appearance, such as zoom level, basemap, point color and map type (2D or 3D).
