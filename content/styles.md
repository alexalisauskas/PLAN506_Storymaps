# Layer Styles
The Style tools available to you will depend on the features in your layer. The default style is Location (single symbol), which shows the geographic boundaries, lines, or points of your data.

If you have multiple fields in your input layer, you will have to select one to map. You can also select two fields which will give you more style options. 

There are many different map types you can create easily on ArcGIS online, so play around with adding fields and seeing the options. We will go through a few map types and how to create them.
