## Visualize Your Layer Data

### Sample Data

You can download the data below and add each file as a layer to your ArcGIS Online webmap to play around with features.

**Vancouver_Commuter_2016.geojson** is a polygon layer with commuter data joined to local area boundaries.

**bikeways.geojson** is a line layer showing Vancouver bike paths

**heritage-sites.geojson** is a point layer showing Vancouver heritage sites.

### Styles

#### Counts and Amounts
Read more about [Data Classification Methods](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/layer-properties/data-classification-methods.htm) and how you might want to use them.

### Filtering for certain elements
Use the filter feature to create a condition and determine what shows up on your map. This feature is useful if you have data that varies in type/category or date. you can also filter to only include features in a certain neighbourhood.

To try{: .label .label-green } 
- On the heritage_sites layer, try filtering to include only archeological sites
- On the Bikeways layer, try filtering out bikeways created in the 1990s
