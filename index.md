## Learning objectives
- Understand the differences between ArcGIS Public vs. Enterprise accounts for Webmaps and Storymaps
- Gain a basic understanding of Storymaps features and how to create one for your project
- Gain a basic understanding of ArcGIS online map creation, including adding layers and simple styling and visualization options, and creating maps to embed in Storyamps
- Learn about places to find basic data you can add to your webmaps


## ArcGIS Online

ArcGIS Online is a cloud-based software that allows you to organize and create GIS projects, which can come in the form of story maps, GIS files created with desktop applications, web maps (more on those below), and more. 

If you have an organizational account with Esri, you can choose to use your regular sign-in or create a separate free account. <https://www.arcgis.com/index.html>

 [Log in with the organization's URL](./setup_url)

 [Create an ArcGIS Public Account](./setup_public)

Today we will be focusing on features in the Public account.
